# Hello

This is meant to be presented as a slide deck.

## Presenting

You have to run a local webserver to serve the files.

`python3 -m http.server 5000`

`open http://localhost:5000`

## Editing

For simple edits, just adjust [slides.md](/slides.md).

For styling, custom CSS, edit [index.html](/index.html).

The [Remark Wiki](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki) is the best place to find out how to do something.
