## [Lara Hogan's Feedback Formula](https://larahogan.me/blog/feedback-equation/)

--

1. Observation
--

1. Impact
--

1. Question

---

# Observation

- Only observable facts
- No opinions
- Who / What / When / Where

---

# Impact

- How it affects you or others
- Get to the root
- Ideally, use an impact that the other person cares about

---

# Question

- A **legitimate** question invites dialogue toward a common solution
- People are more invested in solutions they think of

---

# Practice!

# Scenario - Code Walkthrough

You are walking through your design in a team meeting. The lead engineer on your team, Jackie, looks disinterested and mad through your entire presentation. Her arms are crossed tightly and she looks at her phone several times and leaves early. You're worried she doesn't like the design you created and are nervous about what she's going to say in your next 1:1.

---

# Code Walkthrough - Jackie's POV

You always hate meetings in a particular conference room because there are no windows and it's always way too cold. On the way there you grab your extra-thick hoodie. The new engineer, Elaine, is presenting her database design. It all looks pretty good. You wrap your arms tightly around yourself because it's so cold. 

Elaine is smart so you're not worried about needing to supervise the whole meeting. So you leave early to prepare for an interview. You make a mental note to remember to tell Elaine she did did a good job on the presentation in your next 1:1.

# Scenario - Happy Friday

It's a sunny Friday morning. After having a productive call with a remote team at 7:00am Pacific time, you stop on your way in to the office to grab a coffee from your favorite place. You decide to splurge on a pastry and on your way out run into an old colleague who you really enjoyed working with. You chat for about twenty minutes.

When you finally arrive at work, it's feeling like it'll be a really productive day. You say hello to your desk neighbor, Christina. She doesn't look up and just mutters something like "Nice of you to finally make it in" and doesn't say anything the rest of the morning. Instead of being productive, you stew a little bit about how negative Christina always is and wish you sat near someone else.

---

# Happy Friday - Christina's POV

You are on-call for your team. Right after you sit down at your desk, before you even get your coffee, you get paged for an outage. It's not obvious what's wrong. Two other teams have since Slacked you asking for an update. Right then your desk mate comes in and gives a cheery hello. You realize you've been working for over an hour straight and made no progress and she's just waltzing in at 10:00am. You give her a snarky comment and then go back to work. You figure out the issue and everything is fine before lunch.

# Group Exercise 

## Rewrite this feedback in the O.I.Q. format

### Context
The new engineering intern interrupts you two or three times an hour to ask a question.

### Feedback
Listen, Josh, you can't just ask me questions whenever you get stuck. I have my own work to do. Most things you're asking me are on the team wiki so just look it up yourself next time, okay!
